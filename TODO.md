# TODO: Add Responsive Sidebar to Dashboard Layout

- [x] Update components/ui/sidebar.tsx: Implement proper useSidebar hook and SidebarProvider with React context for managing open/close state and mobile detection.
- [x] Create app/dashboard/layout.tsx: Set up the dashboard layout with SidebarProvider, AppSidebar, and SidebarInset. Handle responsive behavior (large screens: sidebar 20% width, content 80%, no overlap; mobile/tablet: sidebar hidden by default, use Sheet overlay, toggle via hamburger menu; header at top, proper z-index).
- [x] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- [x] Verify all buttons/inputs remain clickable.
- [x] Ensure no pointer-event or overlay issues.
